# TDDC17 – Artificial Intelligence Labs

This repository contains my lab work for the course **TDDC17 Artificial Intelligence** at Linköping University.  
The course introduces fundamental concepts and practical applications of AI, with a focus on search algorithms, planning, reasoning, and agent-based systems.

## 📚 Course Overview
The course covers:
- Classical search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*, etc.)
- Heuristic search and optimization
- Planning and decision-making under uncertainty
- Knowledge representation and reasoning
- Multi-agent systems and robotics applications
- Reinforcement learning and control

## 🧪 Labs
The labs are designed to provide hands-on experience with AI methods and tools:

1. **Search Algorithms** – Implementing classical and heuristic search.
2. **Planning** – Creating agents that can plan actions in dynamic environments.
3. **Multi-Agent Systems** – Designing agents that coordinate and interact.
4. **Reinforcement Learning – Rocket Stabilization** 🚀  
   Implemented an RL agent that learns to stabilize a simulated rocket by balancing control signals in real time.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Java & JavaScript** for most lab implementations
- Provided simulation environments and frameworks from the course
- Algorithms implemented from scratch as well as with course libraries
- Reinforcement Learning techniques (Q-learning / policy optimization)
